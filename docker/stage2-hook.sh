#
# Under s6-overlay this no longer works: the bootstrap (UID remap, volume +
# build-tree chown, config seeding) all require root, and they're skipped when
# the container starts non-root. The baked image trees (/opt/data, /opt/gogeta/
# .venv, ui-tui, node_modules) stay owned by the gogeta build UID (10000), so an
# arbitrary `--user` UID can't write them — the runtime then fails with EACCES
# on a bind mount, or hard-crashes on a named volume (Docker initialises the
# volume from the image as UID 10000, and the non-root start can't even `cd`
# into $GOGETA_HOME). See #34837 for the supervision-tree side of this.
#
# The supported way to match host-side ownership is to start as root (the image
# default) and pass GOGETA_UID/GOGETA_GID — or the PUID/PGID aliases — which the
# remap block below consumes via usermod/groupmod + targeted chown. That gives
# the exact same outcome (files owned by your host UID) without breaking s6.
#
# preinit runs setuid-root (euid=0) but cont-init.d hooks run with the real UID
# the container was started as, so `id -u` here is the host UID (e.g. 1000), and
# `id -u gogeta` is the unremapped build UID (10000) because no root-only remap
# could run. root starts (id -u = 0) and the normal supervised drop to the
# gogeta UID are both unaffected.

[stage2] ERROR: container started with --user $cur_uid (an arbitrary, non-gogeta UID).

This is not supported under the s6-overlay image. The container bootstrap
(UID remap, volume ownership, dependency installs) needs to start as root,
and the baked image directories are owned by the gogeta user (UID $(id -u gogeta)),
so a pinned --user UID cannot write them — startup will fail.

To make container-written files match your HOST user, DON'T use --user.
Start the container as root (the default) and pass your host UID/GID instead:

    docker run -e GOGETA_UID=\$(id -u) -e GOGETA_GID=\$(id -g) ...

NAS users (Synology / unRAID / UGOS) can use the PUID/PGID aliases:

    docker run -e PUID=\$(id -u) -e PGID=\$(id -g) ...

The image remaps the gogeta user to that UID/GID at boot and chowns the data
volume accordingly, so files land owned by your host user — the same outcome
--user was being used for, without breaking the supervision tree.

# --- Docker socket group membership (docker-in-docker / DooD) ---
# When the user bind-mounts the host Docker daemon socket
# (`-v /var/run/docker.sock:/var/run/docker.sock`) to use the `docker`
# terminal backend from inside the container, the socket is owned by the
# host's `docker` group (or root). The supervised gogeta user (UID 10000)
# is not a member of any group that matches the socket's GID, so every
# `docker` invocation EACCES'es and `check_terminal_requirements()` fails.
# See #16703.
#
# Granting the supp group via `docker run --group-add <gid>` alone is
# NOT sufficient with our s6-setuidgid privilege drop: s6-setuidgid (and
# gosu, the older shim) calls initgroups() for the target user, which
# rebuilds the supplementary group list from /etc/group. Without an
# /etc/group entry whose GID matches the socket, the kernel-granted
# supp group is silently wiped between PID 1 and the dropped process.
# Confirmed empirically: `--group-add 998` alone leaves the dropped
# gogeta process with `Groups: 10000` (998 gone); after this hook adds
# the entry, the dropped process has `Groups: 998 10000` as expected.
#
# Fix: detect the socket's GID at boot and ensure /etc/group has a
# matching entry that includes gogeta. Idempotent across container
# restarts. Skipped silently when no socket is bind-mounted.
#
# Handles the awkward corner cases:
#   - socket owned by GID 0 (root) — some Podman setups; usermod -aG root
#   - socket GID already used by a known container group (e.g. tty=5):
#     reuse that group's name rather than creating a duplicate
#   - gogeta is already a member of the right group (idempotent restart)
#   - chown/groupadd failures under rootless containers — non-fatal

# --- Fix ownership of build trees under $INSTALL_DIR ---
# Gogeta-owned trees under $INSTALL_DIR must be re-chowned whenever the

#   - .venv: lazy_deps.py cannot install platform packages (discord.py,
#     telegram, slack, etc.) with EACCES (#15012, #21100)
#   - ui-tui: esbuild rebuilds dist/entry.js on every TUI launch (when
#     the source mtime is newer than dist/ or when GOGETA_TUI_FORCE_BUILD
#     is set) and writes to ui-tui/dist/. Without this chown the new
#     gogeta UID can't write the build output (#28851).
#   - gateway: Python writes __pycache__ and runtime artifacts beneath the
#     gateway package on first import. After a UID remap those source-owned
#     paths still belong to the build-time UID (10000) unless repaired here,
#     producing EACCES for the supervised gateway (#27221).
#   - node_modules: root-level dependencies (puppeteer, web tooling)
#     that runtime code may walk/update.
# The set mirrors the build-time `chown -R gogeta:gogeta` line in the
# Dockerfile — keep them in sync if the Dockerfile chown set changes.
# These are under $INSTALL_DIR (not $GOGETA_HOME), so the bind-mount
# concern doesn't apply — recursive is fine.
#
# This MUST be gated independently of the $GOGETA_HOME ownership check
# above. `usermod -u <new> gogeta` re-chowns the gogeta home dir
# ($GOGETA_HOME == /opt/data) to the new UID as a side effect, so after a
# GOGETA_UID/PUID remap `stat $GOGETA_HOME` always already matches the new
# UID and `needs_chown` is false — but the build trees under /opt/gogeta
# are NOT touched by usermod and remain owned by the build-time UID
# (10000). Gating them on $GOGETA_HOME ownership (as #35027 did) silently
# skipped this chown on the common PUID/NAS path, regressing lazy installs
# and TUI rebuilds. Probe the build trees directly instead: chown only
# when the venv is not already owned by the runtime gogeta UID. Idempotent
# and skips the expensive recursive chown on every restart once ownership
