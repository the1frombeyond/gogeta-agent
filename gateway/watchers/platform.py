    """Best-effort dispose for an adapter that never made it onto ``self.adapters``.

    The reconnect watcher in ``PlatformWatcherMixin._platform_reconnect_watcher``
    constructs a fresh adapter on every retry attempt. When the connect
    call fails — for any of the three reasons (non-retryable error,
    retryable error, exception during connect) — the adapter is dropped
    without ever being installed, so nothing else will call its
    ``disconnect()``. Any resources the adapter opened in ``__init__``
    (e.g. ``APIServerAdapter`` opens a SQLite ``ResponseStore`` that
    holds 2 fds — the db file and its WAL sidecar) stay open until
    garbage collection sweeps the unreachable object, which Python's
    cyclic GC does not do promptly for asyncio-bound objects with
    native handles. The cumulative leak is 2 fds * every retry at the
    300s backoff cap = 12 fds/hour, and the default 2560-fd ulimit
    is exhausted in ~12h of continuous failure, after which every
    open() call on the gateway raises ``OSError: [Errno 24] Too many
    open files`` and the gateway becomes a zombie (#37011).

    This helper centralises the dispose-with-suppression so the three
    failure paths in the reconnect watcher can all call it without
    each one having to know that ``disconnect()`` may itself raise
    on a half-constructed adapter.

    ``adapter`` may be ``None``: the reconnect watcher initialises
    ``adapter = None`` before the ``try`` so the ``except Exception``
    arm can dispose a half-constructed object, and also early-returns
    here when ``_create_adapter()`` returned ``None``.
